# Hangmang!
by Sam Foster. 2022

## INSTRUCTIONS:

You have been kidnapped by a gang of sadistic bibliophiles! They will let
you live if you can correctly guess the letters in a secret word. But if
you make 6 wrong guesses, you're dead! Will you survive the mercilessness?

## MORE INFORMATION:

This is the classic Hangman game in Python 3. It uses ASCII graphics
and should run on any platform that can run Python 3 with the random
module. It has no dependencies, except for an included word list.

Its <40 column ASCII graphics make it suitable for playing on machines
as humble as a teletype/teleprinter, or an Apple II (as, say, a serial
terminal). This is the kind of game you can play from a 50 year old
mainframe console, or an IBM-PC with MDA.

This uses a list of words from the file: hangwords.txt

The words list was obtained by taking the 1000 most common words in the
English language (supposedly) and extracting only the 4 to 6-letter words.
The words list was taken from: https://gist.github.com/deekayen/4148741
